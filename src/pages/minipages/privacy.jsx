          Hey there! Just so you know, all the data we use comes from publicly available sources. We’re not affiliated with any universities or consultants—promise! 🙅‍♂️💼
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Disclaimer: If you're hoping for a magic formula to get into a university, it doesn’t exist (trust us, we’ve tried). We’re not responsible for any dreams dashed by unrealistic promises or magical consultants. 😉
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          A little extra transparency: Some of the information we gather comes from friendly corners of the internet like Reddit threads, student forums, and publicly available university stats. We love a good data dive. 📊🕵️‍♂️
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Also, from time to time, we might ask actual students from different universities to voluntarily share information about their campus, courses, and personal experiences with the university system. These insights help us build valuable blog content and guides for future students. No spooky stories—just facts, tips, and maybe a few laughs. 🎓📚
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Rest assured, we don’t sell, rent, or trade your info for a burger combo or a concert ticket. Everything shared with us is handled respectfully and used solely to improve this platform and make it more helpful for students like you. 🍔🚀
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
          So, just a heads-up: Read the fine Application print, use your own judgment, and remember—you’re the one in control of your application journey! 🎓✨
